# Boggers

Boggers is a nickname for Bits of Good member management portal. Boggers was created to help the club leadership to get relevant information about the members fast.

Besides the usual names, major, year, etc, Boggers can also...

- Allow members to keep track of their technical preferences (e.g. frontend, backend, fullstack, etc.)
- Allow EMs, Designers, and PMs to keep record of the member's contribution and see their past contribution easily

Boggers is still growing and we hope to add many new features to facilitate club logistics!
